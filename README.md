# Plant-Disease-Detection.
Overview This project is a deep learning-based plant disease classifier that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled plant disease datasets.

Features Train a CNN model on plant disease images Predict plant disease from an input image Save and load trained models for inference Visualize training accuracy and loss.
